  <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
</div>
  
<div class="container">
  <p> Artist, are usually self-taught. Without guidance, online material is a must but the vast information overwhelms the artist thus being lost in the progress. To suffice this need, ArTech is produced to tackle these common problems. </p>
</div>

<div class="intro">
  <h2><b>Start of Lesson 1</b></h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>Art starts with consistency and without fail, to be better at something means you have to do it everyday. The amount of time put in doesnt matter, even 10 minutes a day would suffice this need. And so, the first step is making a habit of drawing. A series of exercise will be a waste if not done consistently much like body building. According to the book Atomic Habits by James Clear, "habits shapes up our system".</p> 
  
  <p>After consistency, we might find ourselves consistent in making portraits and figures daily however there will be frustration of not being able to create something better. This is the point, we have drawn everyday only to fail and realize we need to study the fundamentals of art. Thus, the lesson starts.</p>
</div>

<div class="intro">
  <h2><b>Lesson 1: Hand Control </b></h2>
</div>

<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech3.png"></img>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h3><b>Wrist Movement</b></h3>
  <p>Have you ever considered the lines you use to portray your art, how you control your wrist and pressure you apply in the paper?</p>
  
  <p>The lesson starts with series of line, this is to improve the accuracy and muscle memory of being able to create beautiful linear strokes. This is executed through drawing shapes, straight lines and curved lines.</p>
  
  <p>In hand control, we maintain the lightness or thickness of our lines, why? Because lines depict the form of an object and is the first technique applied when drawing. </p>
</div>

<div class="intro">
  <h2><b>Shoulder Movement</b></h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>When drawing, usually we involve the use of our wrist however, did you know that we can draw from our shoulder as well.</p> 

  <p><b>How can this action be performed?</b></p>
  <p>●Try performing the same exercises but your wrist and elbows are lifted just to get the feeling of drawing from your shoulder.</p>
  <p>●The wrist, hand and fingers should be locked and there should be no rotation from the elbow as well.</p> 

  <p><b>Why do we need to practice drawing from shoulder?</b></p> 
  <p>The ability to draw from shoulder emphasizes more control in our lines. When drawing from shoulder we gain access to the ability draw in a larger scale since drawing fron wrist is limited to small area.</p>
</div>

<div class="intro">
  <h2><b>Ghosting</b></h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>In these lesson we also learn the technique of Ghosting Your Lines.</p>
  
  <p><b>What is Ghosting?</b></p>
  
<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech4.png"></img>
</div>
  
  <p><b>Ghosting</b> is a method in where we try to do the motion of drawing the lines with the pen lifted from the paper before actually completing the stroke. This is to maintain the accuracy of the lines and place it to where you want it to be. </p>

<div class="intro">
  <h2><b>Lesson 2: Referencing Shape</b></h2>
</div>

<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech6.png"></img>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>This lesson builds up from the recent topic, we make use of what we have learned from the first lesson and apply it in this section.</p>
  
  <p>After having control of our hands in drawing, next is how we should coordinate our hand with our eyes. In here, we practice being able to copy references.</p>
  
  <p><b>What is reference?</b></p>
  
  <p>In arts, it is an existing subject or to be exact, a model. A <b>Model</b> which we try to replicate, it could be a dog, face, eye or anything you desire to make a copy of.</p>
  
  <p><b>Where do we find references?</b></p>
  
  <p>We may find <b>references</b> with the use of existing technology, it can be either searched in the internet or capture images you want draw.</p>
  
  <p>Now that we know references, what is left is to copy, right? <b>No!</b>We must start from basic references such as vase, bottle, chair, and others. <b>Why?</b> Because replicating complex forms without proper experience first will be too difficult.</p>
  
  <p><b>How do we practice copying references?</b></p>
  
  <p>Now we're getting to the point. To copy a reference is to be able to:</p>
  
  <p>●Breakdown the model into simple shapes.</p>
  
  <p>●To draw only using LIGHT strokes as a build up from Lesson 1. This is required to create a sketch that can easily be erased.</p>
  
  <p>●As last step, outline the sketch and add details to the figure.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="intro">
  <h2><b>Gesture Drawing</b></h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>In addition to referencing shapes, we also make use of the lines we learned from lesson 1 in gesture drawing.</p>
  
  <p><b>What is gesture drawing?</b></p>
  
<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech7.png"></img>
</div>
  
  <p><b>Gesture drawing</b> is simply copying human figures or poses in loose manner where we tend to capture the subjects flow rather than fine details.</p>
  
  <p>Why? It helps us feel the flow of the subject and their movement. It also serves as an exercise, fundamental knowledge, warm-up and builds up our experience in drawing human figure.</p>
  
  <p><b>How is gesture drawing done?</b></p>
  
  <p>We simplify a human figure using basic shapes, as well as C lines and S lines to define the form of the subject.</p>
  
<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech8.png"></img>
</div>
  
  <p>This exercises is needed to be able to free hand copying references. This builds up the ability to see figures and also as you copy more references, you gain information to fill up the visual library and be able to replicate it with enough practice.</p>

  <h2><b>Lesson 3: Basic Forms</b></h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>Now that we are able to copy from a reference, we now learn about Perspective.</p>
  
  <p><b>What is PERSPECTIVE?</b></p>
  
<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech11.png"></img>
</div>
  
  <p>Perspective is the way we view things much like the point of view. It also gives us the illusion of depth, that what we are creating has a solid form and not just a flat character. This makes the drawing more realistically.</p>
  
  <p>Being able to draw from perspective is one of the key to drawing from imagination. This connects from the recent lessons as it tackles on how the subject would look from the side, ¾ view or even at angles that are difficult.</p>
  
  <p>There are several types of perspective, we have 1 point, 2 point and 3 point of perspectives. What are these point of views? Before we learn these, we must know what vanishing points are?</p>
  
</div>

<div class="intro">
  <h2><b>Vanishing Points</b></h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
  
<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech12.png"></img>
</div>
  
  <p> Vanishing points are simply the thing that gives depth to your art and the form of the subject. If we draw a horizontal line and mark the center, it is called vanishing point. </p>
  
  <p>Now the lesson one about lines helps us in these process because we simply place any point in the paper and connect it to the center. The all lines from each point must converge to the vanishing point.</p>
  
  <p><b>What do we do after?</b></p>
  
  <p>As an exercise in this lesson, we make boxes in which, each of its corner is aligned with the vanishing point. </p>
  
<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech13.png"></img>
</div>
  
  <p>Why boxes? Boxes are the simpliest form of structure and is applied in any subject, it is also the key to perspective in its broad topic. It helps us create depth in art.</p>
  
  <p><b>What is the 1, 2, and 3 point of perspective?</b></p>
  
<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech14.png"></img>
</div>
  
  <p>If there is only 1 vanishing which all of your lines converge, it is called 1 point. When there is two, it is called 2 point and. And when there is three, it is called 3 point perspective, as simple as that.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="intro">
  <h2><b>Box Rotation</b></h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p><b>What is box rotation?</b></p>
  
<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech15.png"></img>
</div>
  
  <p>It is just as simple as rotating a box. However, these will serve as a fundamental knowledge in understanding in perspective. Without the use of vanishing points, we must be able to intuitively create depth with our boxes.</p>
  
  <p>These exercises will give us the ability to perceive forms in perspective and depict it using boxes.</p>
  
  <p><b>Draw using Boxes</b></p>
  
  <p>After learning how to draw boxes, how do we apply it in our drawing? It is the key to drawing figures from imagination.</p>
  
  <p>For this exercise, we are gonna draw from a simple reference and think of how it would look from another angle?</p>
  
  <p>We place bounding boxes on the basic form, for example is a vase. How would it look fron certain angles?</p>
  
<div class="ImagesA">
  <img src="ArTech16.png"></img>
</div>
  
  <p>This exercise trains our mind to be creative and enhance our ability to create forms from imagination. However, drawing from imagination is a myth and we are able to draw because what we imagine comes from our visual library thats why references helps us gain more information to be able to create compelling art. </p>
